// Global store for Chef Alerg
//
// This file defines a simple Zustand powered store for the game.  The
// store centralizes all mutable game state, including the current
// phase, the player's profile and any other cross cutting data.  In
// addition to reducing React prop drilling, a centralized store
// makes it trivial for nonâ€‘React code (like the Phaser engine) to
// read and update state via events.  See usage in GameWrapper and
// MemoryGame for examples.
